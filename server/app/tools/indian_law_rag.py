Indian Law RAG Tool (Layer 2 — Tool 3: retrieve_indian_law_context)

RAG-based retrieval of Indian legal context for document validation.
Searches across:
- Bare Acts (via Indian Kanoon API)
- State-specific Stamp Acts
- Case law and judicial precedents
- Statutory requirements and forms

Uses the existing IndianKanoonTool + CrimeRAGSystem as underlying data sources
but provides a validation-focused interface.

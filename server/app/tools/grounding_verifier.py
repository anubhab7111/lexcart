"""
grounding_verifier.py — sentence-level semantic grounding gate.

citation_verifier.py answers "does this citation exist, under the right
Act, among what was retrieved?" — but a citation can pass all three checks
and the sentence built around it can still misstate what the provision
says: drop an exception, reverse a condition, or assert an absolute rule
the text doesn't support. This module checks the *claim*, not just the
citation token.

Pipeline (cheapest checks first, LLM used only as a last resort):
  1. Split the answer into sentence-ish spans (deterministic, regex-free
     manual scan — markdown headers/bullets become their own span).
  2. For each sentence carrying a citation, pull the evidence text for
     that exact provision via `rag.find_section` — no new retrieval,
     no LLM, same corpus citation_verifier already trusts.
     Sentences with no citation but a high-risk absolute claim (see below)
     fall back to whatever retrieved-context text the caller passed in.
  3. Score word overlap between claim and evidence (same heuristic family
     as metrics/generation_metrics._keyword_faithfulness) -> base status.
  4. Scan both claim and evidence for exception/negation trigger words
     (except, unless, subject to, provided that, shall not, only if) and
     diff them -> CONTRADICTED override when the claim invents or drops one.
  5. High-risk absolute language (must/cannot/always/never/abolished/
     unconstitutional/invalid/removed/no longer) demands a higher overlap
     bar; sentences that clear UNGROUNDED but fall short of that bar are
     provisionally PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED pending step 6, instead of being
     trusted on weak word overlap alone.
  6. Sentences that are CONTRADICTED, UNGROUNDED-with-a-citation, or
     high-risk-and-not-clearly-supported go into ONE batched LLM call that
     both finalizes their status and rewrites them from evidence only.
     Everything else never touches the LLM.

With no flagged sentences (the common case) this adds zero LLM calls on
top of the existing citation check — regex + dict lookups only. Worst
case is exactly one extra small-model call per answer, never one per
sentence, and a failed/unavailable LLM degrades to "deterministic report,
advisory footer only" — the same fail-open behavior citation_verifier uses.

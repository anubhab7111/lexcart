civil_rag.py — Civil Law Domain RAG System

Handles: Indian Contract Act 1872, Transfer of Property Act 1882,
         Code of Civil Procedure 1908, Specific Relief Act 1963,
         Negotiable Instruments Act 1881, Limitation Act 1963,
         Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005,
         Right to Information Act 2005, and others.

Key design decisions
--------------------
* NO punishment-clause filter. Civil law is built on rights,
  obligations, and remedies — not criminal sentences. Sections like
  Indian Contract Act § 10 ("What agreements are contracts") have no
  "shall be punished" clause but are the foundation of contract law.
  Filtering them out was the root cause of hallucinations.

* _preprocess_query() expands civil vocabulary (breach of contract,
  damages, remedies, etc.) without ever mapping to IPC sections.

* retrieve() is the universal entry-point from the chatbot.
  The result is returned as a LegalContext (new type) rather than the
  old RAGResult (criminal-specific type).

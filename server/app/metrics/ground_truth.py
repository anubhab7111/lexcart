"""
Ground truth dataset for evaluating the legal chatbot RAG pipeline.

Each entry contains:
  - query              : The exact test prompt
  - relevant_ipc_sections : IPC/CrPC sections the RAG system *should* surface
                            (used for Hit Rate@k and MRR)
  - relevant_keywords  : Legal terms/acts/concepts that must appear in a
                         high-quality answer (used for lightweight Context Recall)
  - expected_acts      : Statutes / constitutional provisions that should be cited
  - reference_answer   : A concise gold-standard answer used by the LLM judge for
                         Context Recall and Faithfulness evaluation
  - domain             : Broad legal domain tag for filtering/reporting

NOTE: relevant_ipc_sections intentionally contains ONLY IPC/BNS section numbers
usable for Hit Rate@k / MRR scoring. Constitutional, contract, property, and
family-law queries have empty lists because those domains cite Articles/
sections from other Acts (or, for family law, an act with no RAG index at
all) rather than IPC sections; those queries are evaluated on generation
quality (faithfulness / context recall / answer relevance) using context
retrieved from the matching civil/constitutional RAG system instead.
